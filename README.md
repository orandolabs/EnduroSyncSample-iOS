This is a sample of EnduroSync for iOS. Some notes:

1. Do a 'pod update' after downloading the sample.

2. Toward the top of EnduroSyncModel.m, there are several static strings that you need to replace with your own values (kNs, kApp, etc.)

3. This sample works well with the Android sample. If you run this sample, and then run the Android sample (or vice versa), you'll get a synced object store.

The sample is a simple named preferences object that contains some prefereneces and a list of link objects.
